# jsouplesse

Contains different ways of reading company data (or just an url) of a web shop from aggregate web sites.

The desktop application constructs a custom selector based on user input and uses this to scan for a url that hopefully 
is the home page of a web shop. The resulting url's are then written to a .txt and .csv file.
